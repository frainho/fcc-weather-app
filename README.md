# weatherApp

As a part of the Free Code Camp challenges I needed to build a Weather App that uses your location to display the weather. Aditionally there was need to display a descriptive image of the weather and an option to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Getting the location was done using the native HTML 5 method.
I fetched the descriptive weather images from the API. The API was provided by Free Code Camp: https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me
The switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit was made through the standard conversion formula. The API provided the temperature in Celsius and by multiplying by 5/9 adding 32.

Learning how to make the switch and changing the text of the button with jQuery were the most interesting challenges to overcome in this project.
